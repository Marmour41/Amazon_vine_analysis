# Amazon_vine_analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. I selected the video game review dataset to perform the analysis on. 

## Results
- The total amount of Vine reviews, the number of 5-star vine reviews, and the percentage is shown on the [Vine reviews dataframe](vine_reviews.png).
- The total amount of non-Vine reviews, the number of 5-star reviews for non-Vine reviews, and the percentage is shown on the [Other reviews dataframe](other_reviews.png).

## Summary 
Based on the results from my analysis, there does seem to be some positivity bias for reviews int he Vine program. The number of five-star reviews in the Vine program was a little over 50%, while the other reviews only had about 39% five-star reviews. To further delve into this dataset, I would look at each of the stars compared to the total amount of stars. I consider a four-star rating positive as well, so I would like to see how the number of four-star reviews compare between the Vine program and other reviews.
